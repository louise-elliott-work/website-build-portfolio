      <h2>About me!</h2>
      <!-- This summary will be updated once more professional experience has been gained. -->
      <p>I am currently doing the Front End Web Development bootcamp with EdX. My professional background is in the
        charity sector (conservation and health) in finance, admin and audit roles, and in the education sector, having
        worked as an English teacher abroad short-term and as a secondary school languages teacher in the UK for six
        years. I have a first class BSc (Hons) in International Management and Spanish and a PGCE in secondary modern
        foreign languages teaching. The next step is to apply my skills and expertise in a web development role and it
        is something about which I am very excited!</p>
